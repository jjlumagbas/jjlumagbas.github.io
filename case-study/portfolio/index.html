      <p class="leading">My goal was to put up a portfolio site as quickly and simply as possible. I decided to take the
        same route as <a href="https://css-irl.info/building-a-dependency-free-site/">Michelle
          Barker</a>: no build tools, no pre-processors, just static hand-coded HTML+CSS. It was an opportunity for me
        to,
        erm, Flex my modern CSS layout skills, so I was eager to get on it.</p>

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <p>First I listed out what I actually wanted on there, and then I banged out initial copy for the home page and
        collected some images. I held back from making the copy (or images) perfect, just so I could get started laying
        it
        out (i.e. the fun part). I would revisit the copy multiple times throughout the process, tweaking
        as I went. </p>

      <h2>Typography</h2>

      <p>For my <a href="/jjlumagbas-resume-frontend.pdf">resumé</a>, I&#8217;d already adopted the awesome Source <a
          href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro">Sans</a>/<a
          href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro">Serif</a> Pro family from Adobe, so I stuck with
        that, only adding in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono">Space Mono</a> later on, which I
        love
        since it's edgy but in a way that's still somewhat relevant. (And those italics! Ugh.)</p>

      <p>To minimize markup, I wanted to reuse styles as much as possible, so I narrowed it down to these:</p>

      <h1>Big headings</h1>

      <h2>Subheadings</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Tag-like text (captions share the same style)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><a href="">Links</a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Blockquotes&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>And of course paragraph text.</p>

      <p>Apply styles, preview in browser, tweak sizes, line-heights, character spacing. Rinse. Repeat.</p>

      <h2>Layout</h2>

      <p>I started with semantic markup and then checked to see how it looked on the browser before any CSS. I then
        worked
        my way through a mobile layout, then a layout for larger screens.</p>

      <p>My overall vision for the layout was an organic feel, with alignment variations on the cards,
        versus having everything line up on a strict grid. Online portfolios of <a
          href="https://www.firstborn.com/">Firstborn</a> and <a href="https://today.design/">Today</a> served as
        inspiration. </p>

      <p>For the images, I found a fun treatment in some parenting magazine at the library. I like how the drop shadow
        serves as a visual bridge between an image and the heading or caption underneath it.</p>

          alt="Magazine spread with a photo of a dog surrounded by a translucent yellow border">
        <figcaption>Image treatment from a parenting magazine</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Deploy</h2>

      <p>Hosting the site on Github Pages was the most obvious choice and most testing was done here, but Netlify really
        has it beat in terms of site-load speed. And the setup was dead-easy.</p>

      <p>And done! All throughout, I resisted the urge to get fancy, keeping <a
          href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/">Frank Chimero&#8217;s words</a> in
        mind:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Directness is best in my experience, so a great photo, memorable illustration, or pitch-perfect
          sentence does
          most of the work. Beyond that, fancy implementation has never moved the needle much for my clients.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Did I succeed? Let me know!</p>
