    <p class="leading">My goal was to put up a portfolio site as quickly and simply as possible. I decided to take the
      same route as <a href="https://css-irl.info/building-a-dependency-free-site/">Michelle
        Barker</a>: no build tools, no pre-processors, just static hand-coded HTML+CSS. It was an opportunity for me to,
      erm, Flex my modern CSS layout skills, so I was eager to get on it.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_0">Content</h2>

    <p>First I listed out what I actually wanted on there, and then I banged out initial copy for the home page and
      collected some images. I held back from making the copy (or images) perfect, just so I could get started laying it
      out (i.e the fun part). I would revisit the copy multiple times throughout the process, tweaking
      as I went. </p>

    <h2 id="toc_1">Typography</h2>

    <p>For my resumé, I&#8217;d already adopted the awesome Source Sans/Serif Pro family from Adobe, so I stuck with
      that, only adding in Space Mono later on, which I love since it's edgy but in a way that's somewhat relevant.</p>

    <p>To minimize markup, I wanted to reuse styles as much as possible, so I narrowed it down to these:</p>

    <h1 id="toc_2">Big headings</h1>

    <h2 id="toc_3">Subheadings</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Tag-like text (captions share the same style)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="">Links</a></p>

    <p>And of course paragraph text.</p>

    <p>Apply styles, preview in browser, tweak sizes, line-heights, character spacing. Rinse. Repeat.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_4">Layout</h2>

    <p>I started with semantic markup and then checked to see how it looked on the browser before any CSS. I then worked
      my way through a mobile layout, then a layout for larger screens.</p>

    <p>My overall vision for the layout was for it to have an organic feel, with alignment variations on the cards,
      versus having everything line up on a strict grid. Online portfolios of <a
        href="https://www.firstborn.com/">Firstborn</a> and <a href="https://today.design/">Today</a> served as
      inspiration. </p>

    <p>For the images, I found a fun treatment in some parenting magazine at the library. I like how it serves as a
      visual bridge between images and headings or captions underneath it.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_5">Deploy</h2>

    <p>Hosting the site on Github Pages was the most obvious choice and most testing was done here, but Netlify really
      has it beat in terms of site-load speed. And the setup was dead-easy.</p>

    <p>All throughout, I resisted the urge to get fancy, keeping <a
        href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/">Frank Chimero&#39;s words</a> in mind:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Directness is best in my experience, so a great photo, memorable illustration, or pitch-perfect sentence does
        most of the work. Beyond that, fancy implementation has never moved the needle much for my clients.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Did I succeed? Let me know!</p>
