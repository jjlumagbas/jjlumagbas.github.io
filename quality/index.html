            <p>
              Major feature update that required changes to multiple front-ends, as well as the underlying data model
              and
              backend API
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">My role</h3>
            <p>
              Product Management: Document existing user flows and design updated user flows, UI sketches, and
              mockups;
              Lead
              implementation, manage remote developers, assemble and maintain sprint backlogs
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Extra challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Distributed team: The company is based in Austin, I worked remotely from South Texas, and I managed devs
              who
              operated out of the Philippines.

            <h3 class="subheading">Extra extra challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The original devs had moved on from the company! So initial work was needed to document existing user
              flows,
              to effectively onboard new set of developers
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              We successfully implemented and deployed the feature update, which opened up the platform to a
              significantly
              broader set of customers (schools)

            I helped design and launch a feature to allow schools to manage
            separate hiring pipelines for different job openings (then, the platform allowed for only a single
            pipeline).
            This required changes to multiple frontends, as well as the underlying data model and backend API.

            </span><br />
            But first...
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before we could start designing the new feature, we first needed a clear picture of existing user flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the original devs had already moved on from the company, and we were onboarding new devs, plus the
            team
            was distributed across two timezones, written (or in this case, drawn) documentation that could serve as
            reference for the team was critical.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get a solid picture of the existing user flows, I:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>conducted multiple interviews with the VP Product (the remaining member of the original team),</li>
            <li>sent questions to the original devs (who at that point were working at new jobs),</li>
            <li>did some code-diving (my CS background proved useful here), and</li>
            <li>stepped through the platform as a user to see which buttons led where.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result of this process is the below diagram. Notice that it's a) rough, since this was intended for the
            development team eyes only, and needed to be foremost functional, and not necessarily pretty, and b)
            jam-packed
            with as much information as I could fit in, to serve as a single-page reference for most major steps in the
            various user flows.

            From this point, together with VP Product, I then mapped out modified user flows with the new

            feature implemented. This diagram again is a sort of hybrid, combining information about:

            <li>data entities that get created at various stages.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it zooms out a bit to capture marketing efforts (on the right-hand side), as well as
              potential
              organizational structures of customers (schools).</li>

            With a good understanding of the existing (and target) user flows, design of the actual screens to support
            the
            change turned out to be fairly straightforward. I wrote user stories, and drew up sketches and mockups to
            serve
            as specs for the devs.

        <p>

          Lots of other software platforms do this: for instance, Trello for multiple boards (left), and Gmail for
          multiple accounts (right). It's a common enough pattern, and seemed intuitive enough for users to adopt.

            <p>
              In a previous paragraph I said this UI change <em>seemed intuitive enough for users to adopt</em>. How did
              I
              know this? Two possible answers:
            </p>
            <span></span>
            <p>
              <span class="subheading">I Don't!</span>
              I'm not the user, so this is definitely an assumption I'm making. Ideally, we would have done usability
              tests
              on mockups with a few actual users to validate assumptions before doing any actual implementation. In this
              case, the team bias was more towards shipping a likely good enough solution, and so we skipped usability
              testing.
            </p>
            <span></span>
            <p>
              <span class="subheading">Heuristics</span>
              This decision, however, was not at all merely a shot in the dark: <a
                href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law">Jakob Nielsen says users spend most of the time on other
                sites</a>, and so using a common UI pattern had a good chance of succeeding at communicating behavior.

        </aside>
        <div>
          <p>
            As a bonus, the pattern is flexible enough to keep the door open for future feature updates, for
            instance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To restrict view rights for various users, just filter the list of pipelines that are visible for
              that
              user.
            </li>
            <li>Will the user want to view multiple pipelines at once? Add checkboxes to each pipeline in the
              dropdown,
              and
              allow users to select multiple pipelines.</li>
          </ul>

                (that's

            Vision to actionable specs

          <p>
            I successfully bridged the gap between VP Product, who carried the product vision, and translate that
            vision
            into feature specs for the development team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We did, however, experience some development delays. Note for next time: ensure devs are actively involved
            in
            creating sprint targets, and have them own the backlog!
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, we were able to implement and deploy the multiple-pipeline feature, opening up the platform to
            a
            significantly broader set of school customers.

            For me, this project highlighted the ability of visual documentation to be an efficient repository of
            information: they're quick to produce, you can pack in a lot of information, and with enough shared
            understanding they are evocative for the reader without being verbose.
