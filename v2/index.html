        Quality People: User flow analysis and design for a new dashboard feature

        Quality People uses clever marketing and big-data analytics to help schools find teachers who best fit open
        positions. It allows schools to launch targeted marketing to job-seekers, and then usher applicants through
        their hiring pipeline.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-centered">
        I helped design and launch a feature to allow schools to manage
        separate hiring pipelines for different job openings (then, the platform allowed for only a single pipeline).
        This required changes to multiple frontends, as well as the underlying data model and backend API.

          Distributed team: The company is based in Austin, I worked remotely from South Texas, and I managed devs who
          operated out of the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Extra extra challenge</span>
          The original devs had moved on from the company! So initial work was needed to document existing user flows,
          to effectively onboard new set of developers
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Outcome</span>
          We successfully implemented and deployed the feature update, which opened up the platform to a significantly
          broader set of customers (schools)

        Documenting existing user flows
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">
        But first...
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before we could start designing the new feature, we first needed a clear picture of existing user flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the original devs had already moved on from the company, and we were onboarding new devs, plus the team
        was distributed across two timezones, written (or in this case, drawn) documentation that could serve as
        reference for the team was critical.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get a solid picture of the existing user flows, I:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>conducted multiple interviews with the VP Product (the remaining member of the original team),</li>
        <li>sent questions to the original devs (who at that point were working at new jobs),</li>
        <li>did some code-diving (my CS background proved useful here), and</li>
        <li>stepped through the platform as a user to see which buttons led where.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result of this process is the below diagram. Notice that it's a) rough, since this was intended for the
        development team eyes only, and needed to be foremost functional, and not necessarily pretty, and b) jam-packed
        with as much information as I could fit in, to serve as a single-page reference for most major steps in the
        various user flows.
      </p>

        From this point, together with VP Product, I then mapped out modified user flows with the new multiple-pipelines
        feature implemented. This diagram again is a sort of hybrid, combining information about:

      <ul>
        <li>the platform components that different user types interact with</li>
        <li>data entities that get created at various stages.</li>
        <li>Additionally, it zooms out a bit to capture marketing efforts (on the right-hand side), as well as potential
          organizational structures of customers (schools).</li>
      </ul>

        UI Changes

      <h2 class="title">
        (Not) reinventing the wheel
      </h2>
      <p>
        With a good understanding of the existing (and target) user flows, design of the actual screens to support the
        change turned out to be fairly straightforward. I wrote user stories, and drew up sketches and mockups to serve
        as specs for the devs.

        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Problem</span>
          What's the simplest way to allow a school hiring manager to view a different hiring pipeline, given he already
          had a Trello-like dashboard to show a single hiring pipeline?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Solution</span>
          A project-switcher dropdown.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        Lots of other software platforms do this: for instance, Trello for multiple boards (left), and Gmail for
        multiple accounts (right). It's a common enough pattern, and seemed intuitive enough for users to adopt.
      </p>

      <img class="grid-full block" src="../../images/sherlock.jpg"
        alt="Screenshot of the full dashboard interface for Quality People">

      <p>
        As a bonus, the pattern is flexible enough to keep the door open for future feature updates, for instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To restrict view rights for various users, just filter the list of pipelines that are visible for that user.
        </li>
        <li>Will the user want to view multiple pipelines at once? Add checkboxes to each pipeline in the dropdown, and
          allow users to select multiple pipelines.</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="sidebar block is-size-6">
        <p class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Reflection sidebar</p>
        <p>
          A few paragraphs back I said this UI change <em>seemed intuitive enough for users to adopt</em>. How did I
          know this? Two possible answers:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">I Don't!</span>
          I'm not the user, so this is definitely an assumption I'm making. Ideally, we would have done usability tests
          on mockups with a few actual users to validate assumptions before doing any actual implementation. In this
          case, the team bias was more towards shipping a likely good enough solution, and so we skipped usability
          testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="is-uppercase has-text-weight-bold is-size-7">Heuristics</span>
          This decision, however, was not at all merely a shot in the dark: Jakob Nielsen says users spend most of the
          time on other sites, and so using a common UI pattern had a good chance of succeeding at communicating
          behavior.

            Here's a sketch I made of the school hiring manager dashboard with the dropdown labelled "Projects" (that's

        Vision to actionable specs
      </h2>
      <p>
        I successfully bridged the gap between VP Product, who carried the product vision, and translate that vision
        into feature specs for the development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        We did, however, experience some development delays. Note for next time: ensure devs are actively involved in
        creating sprint targets, and have them own the backlog!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, we were able to implement and deploy the multiple-pipeline feature, opening up the platform to a
        significantly broader set of school customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, this project highlighted the ability of visual documentation to be an efficient repository of
        information: they're quick to produce, you can pack in a lot of information, and with enough shared
        understanding they are evocative for the reader without being verbose.

        For any details that need clarifying, you can just hash it out in your project management tool (Github Projects,
        in our case).
